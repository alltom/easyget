  body: Proper nonblocking I/O was added to Ruby 1.8.4 in May 2006. If we have it, then we can read multiple times safely to improve performance. The last-activity clock ASSUMES that we only come here when we have selected readable. TODO, coalesce multiple reads into a single event. TODO, do the function check somewhere else and cache it.
