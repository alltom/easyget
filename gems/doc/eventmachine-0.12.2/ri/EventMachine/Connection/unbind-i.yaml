  body: EventMachine::Connection#unbind is called by the framework whenever a connection (either a server or client connection) is closed. The close can occur because your code intentionally closes it (see close_connection and close_connection_after_writing), because the remote peer closed the connection, or because of a network error. You may not assume that the network connection is still open and able to send or receive data when the callback to unbind is made. This is intended only to give you a chance to clean up associations your code may have made to the connection object while it was open.
