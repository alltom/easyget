  body: comm_inactivity_timeout returns the current value (in seconds) of the inactivity-timeout property of network-connection and datagram-socket objects. A nonzero value indicates that the connection or socket will automatically be closed if no read or write activity takes place for at least that number of seconds. A zero value (the default) specifies that no automatic timeout will take place.
