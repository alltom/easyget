  body: "Make a connection to a Unix-domain socket. This is not implemented on Windows platforms. The parameter socketname is a String which identifies the Unix-domain socket you want to connect to. socketname is the name of a file on your local system, and in most cases is a fully-qualified path name. Make sure that your process has enough local permissions to open the Unix-domain socket. See also the documentation for #connect_server. This method behaves like #connect_server in all respects except for the fact that it connects to a local Unix-domain socket rather than a TCP socket. NOTE: this functionality will soon be subsumed into the #connect method. This method will still be supported as an alias."
