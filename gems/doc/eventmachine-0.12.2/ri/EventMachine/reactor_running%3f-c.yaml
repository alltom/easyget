- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Tells you whether the EventMachine reactor loop is currently running. Returns true or false. Useful when writing libraries that want to run event-driven code, but may be running in programs that are already event-driven. In such cases, if EventMachine#reactor_running? returns false, your code can invoke EventMachine#run and run your application code inside the block passed to that method. If EventMachine#reactor_running? returns true, just execute your event-aware code.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This method is necessary because calling EventMachine#run inside of another call to EventMachine#run generates a fatal error.
