- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "For advanced users. This function sets the default timer granularity, which by default is slightly smaller than 100 milliseconds. Call this function to set a higher or lower granularity. The function affects the behavior of #add_timer and #add_periodic_timer. Most applications will not need to call this function."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The argument is a number of milliseconds. Avoid setting the quantum to very low values because that may reduce performance under some extreme conditions. We recommend that you not set a quantum lower than 10.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: You may only call this function while an EventMachine loop is running (that is, after a call to EventMachine#run and before a subsequent call to EventMachine#stop).
