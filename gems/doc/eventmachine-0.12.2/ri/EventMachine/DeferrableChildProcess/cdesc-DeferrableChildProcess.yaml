  body: "EM::DeferrableChildProcess is a sugaring of a common use-case involving EM::popen. Call the #open method on EM::DeferrableChildProcess, passing a command-string. #open immediately returns an EM::Deferrable object. It also schedules the forking of a child process, which will execute the command passed to #open. When the forked child terminates, the Deferrable will be signalled and execute its callbacks, passing the data that the child process wrote to stdout."
