  body: Evaluate arg (which may be an expression or a block). What's the class of arg? If arg is an ordinary expression, then return it. If arg is deferrable (responds to :set_deferred_status), then look at the arguments. If either callback or errback are defined, then use them. If neither are defined, then use the supplied block (if any) as the callback. Then return arg.
