- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Sets the maximum number of file or socket descriptors that your process may open. You can pass this method an integer specifying the new size of the descriptor table. Returns the new descriptor-table size, which may be less than the number you requested. If you call this method with no arguments, it will simply return the current size of the descriptor table without attempting to change it.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The new limit on open descriptors ONLY applies to sockets and other descriptors that belong to EventMachine. It has NO EFFECT on the number of descriptors you can create in ordinary Ruby code.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Not available on all platforms. Increasing the number of descriptors beyond its default limit usually requires superuser privileges. (See #set_effective_user for a way to drop superuser privileges while your program is running.)"
