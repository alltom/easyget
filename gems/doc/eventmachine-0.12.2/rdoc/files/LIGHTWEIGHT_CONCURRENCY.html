<a href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> (EM) adds two
different formalisms for lightweight concurrency to the Ruby
programmer&#8216;s toolbox: spawned processes and deferrables. This note
will show you how to use them.
</p>
<h3>What is Lightweight Concurrency?</h3>
<p>
We use the term &quot;Lightweight Concurrency&quot; (LC) to refer to
concurrency mechanisms that are lighter than Ruby threads. By
&quot;lighter,&quot; we mean: less resource-intensive in one or more
dimensions, usually including memory and CPU usage. In general, you turn to
LC in the hope of improving the performance and scalability of your
programs.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the two <a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> mechanisms we will
discuss here, Ruby has at least one other LC construct: Fibers, which are
currently under development in Ruby 1.9.
</p>
<p>
The technical feature that makes all of these LC mechanisms different from
standard Ruby threads is that they are not scheduled automatically.
</p>
<p>
When you create and run Ruby threads, you can assume (within certain
constraints) that your threads will all be scheduled fairly by Ruby&#8216;s
runtime. Ruby itself is responsible for giving each of your threads its own
share of the total runtime.
</p>
<p>
But with LC, your program is responsible for causing different execution
paths to run. In effect, your program has to act as a &quot;thread
scheduler.&quot; Scheduled entities in LC run to completion and are never
preempted. The runtime system has far less work to do since it has no need
to interrupt threads or to schedule them fairly. This is what makes LC
lighter and faster.
</p>
<p>
You&#8216;ll learn exactly how LC scheduling works in practice as we work
through specific examples.
</p>
<h3><a href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> Lightweight Concurrency</h3>
<p>
Recall that EM provides a reactor loop that must be running in order for
your programs to perform event-driven logic. An EM program typically has a
structure like this:
</p>
<pre>
 require 'eventmachine'

 # your initializations

 EM.run {
     # perform event-driven I/O here, including network clients,
     # servers, timers, and thread-pool operations.
 }

 # your cleanup
 # end of the program
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/EventMachine.html#M000249">EventMachine#run</a>
executes the reactor loop, which causes your code to be called as events of
interest to your program occur. The block you pass to <a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html#M000249">EventMachine#run</a> is
executed right after the reactor loop starts, and is the right place to
start socket acceptors, etc.
</p>
<p>
Because the reactor loop runs constantly in an EM program (until it is
stopped by a call to <a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html#M000278">EventMachine#stop</a>), it has
the ability to schedule blocks of code for asynchronous execution. Unlike a
pre-emptive thread scheduler, it&#8216;s NOT able to interrupt code blocks
while they execute. But the scheduling capability it does have is enough to
enable lightweight concurrency.

</p>
<h3>[SIDEBAR]: I Heard That <a href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> Doesn&#8216;t Work With Ruby Threads.</h3>
<p>
This is incorrect. EM is fully interoperable with all versions of Ruby
threads, and has been since its earliest releases.
</p>
<p>
It&#8216;s very true that EM encourages an &quot;evented&quot;
(non-threaded) programming style. The specific benefits of event-driven
programming are far better performance and scalabiity for well-written
programs, and far easier debugging.
</p>
<p>
The benefit of using threads for similar applications is a possibly more
intuitive programming model, as well as the fact that threads are already
familiar to most programmers. Also, bugs in threaded programs often fail to
show up until programs go into production. These factors create the
illusion that threaded programs are easier to write.
</p>
<p>
However, some operations that occur frequently in professional-caliber
applications simply can&#8216;t be done without threads. (The classic
example is making calls to database client-libraries that block on network
I/O until they complete.)
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> not only allows the
use of Ruby threads in these cases, but it even provides a built-in
thread-pool object to make them easier to work with.
</p>
<p>
You may have heard a persistent criticism that evented I/O is fundamentally
incompatible with Ruby threads. It is true that some well-publicized
attempts to incorporate event-handling libraries into Ruby were not
successful. But <a href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> was
designed from the ground up with Ruby compatibility in mind, so EM never
suffered from the problems that defeated the earlier attempts.
</p>
<h3>[SIDEBAR]: I Heard That <a href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> Doesn&#8216;t Work Very Well On Windows.</h3>
<p>
This too is incorrect. <a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> is an extension
written in C++ and Java, and therefore it requires compilation. Many
Windows computers (and some Unix computers, especially in production
environments) don&#8216;t have a build stack. Attempting to install <a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> on a machine without a
compiler usually produces a confusing error.
</p>
<p>
In addition, Ruby has a much-debated issue with Windows compiler versions.
Ruby on Windows works best with Visual Studio 6, a compiler version that is
long out-of-print, no longer supported by Microsoft, and difficult to
obtain. (This problem is not specific to <a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Shortly after <a href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> was
first released, the compiler issues led to criticism that EM was
incompatible with Windows. Since that time, every <a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> release has been
supplied in a precompiled binary form for Windows users, that does not
require you to compile the code yourself. EM binary Gems for Windows are
compiled using Visual Studio 6.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> does supply some
advanced features (such as Linux EPOLL support, reduced-privilege
operation, UNIX-domain sockets, etc.) that have no meaningful
implementation on Windows. Apart from these special cases, all EM
functionality (including lightweight concurrency) works perfectly well on
Windows.
