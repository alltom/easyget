      <p>
<a href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> now supports epoll,
bringing large increases in performance and scalability to Ruby programs.
</p>
<p>
Epoll(7) is a alternative mechanism for multiplexed I/O that is available
in Linux 2.6 kernels. It features significantly greater performance than
the standard select(2) mechanism, when used in applications that require
very large numbers of open I/O descriptors.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> has always used
select(2) because its behavior is well standardized and broadly supported.
But select becomes unreasonably slow when a program has a very large number
of file descriptors or sockets. Ruby&#8216;s version of select hardcodes a
limit of 1024 descriptors per process, but heavily loaded processes will
start to show performance degradation even after only a few hundred
descriptors are in use.
</p>
<p>
Epoll is an extended version of the poll(2) call, and it solves the
problems with select. Programs based on epoll can easily scale past
Ruby&#8216;s 1024-descriptor limit, potentially to tens of thousands of
connectors, with no significant impact on performance.
</p>
<p>
(Another alternative which is very similar to epoll in principle is kqueue,
supplied on BSD and its variants.)
</p>
<p>
This note shows you how to use epoll in your programs.
</p>
<h3>Compiling <a href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> to use epoll.</h3>
<p>
You don&#8216;t have to do anything to get epoll support in <a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a>. When you compile <a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> on a platform that
supports epoll, EM will automatically generate a Makefile that includes
epoll. (At this writing, this will only work on Linux 2.6 kernels.) If you
compile EM on a platform without epoll, then epoll support will be omitted
from the Makefile, and EM will work just as it always has.
</p>
<h3>Using epoll in your programs.</h3>
<p>
First, you need to tell <a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> to use epoll instead
of select (but see below, as this requirement will be removed in a future
<a href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a> version). Second,
you need to prepare your program to use more than 1024 descriptors, an
operation that generally requires superuser privileges. Third, you will
probably want your process to drop the superuser privileges after you
increase your process&#8216;s descriptor limit.
</p>
<h3>Using <a href="../classes/EventMachine.html#M000290">EventMachine#epoll</a></h3>
<p>
Call the method <a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html#M000290">EventMachine#epoll</a> anytime
before you call <a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html#M000249">EventMachine#run</a>, and your
program will automatically use epoll, if available. It&#8216;s safe to call
<a href="../classes/EventMachine.html#M000290">EventMachine#epoll</a> on
any platform because it compiles to a no-op on platforms that don&#8216;t
support epoll.
</p>
<pre>
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'eventmachine'

  EM.epoll
  EM.run {
    ...
  }
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/EventMachine.html#M000290">EventMachine#epoll</a> was
included in this initial release only to avoid changing the behavior of
existing programs. However, it&#8216;s expected that a future release of EM
will convert <a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html#M000290">EventMachine#epoll</a> to a
no-op, and run epoll by default on platforms that support it.
</p>
<h3>Using <a href="../classes/EventMachine.html#M000269">EventMachine#set_descriptor_table_size</a></h3>
<p>
In Linux (as in every Unix-like platform), every process has a internal
table that determines the maximum number of file and socket descriptors you
may have open at any given time. The size of this table is generally fixed
at 1024, although it may be increased within certain system-defined hard
and soft limits.
</p>
<p>
If you want your <a href="../classes/EventMachine.html">EventMachine</a>
program to support more than 1024 total descriptors, you must use <a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html#M000269">EventMachine#set_descriptor_table_size</a>,
as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'eventmachine'

  new_size = EM.set_descriptor_table_size( 60000 )
  $&gt;.puts &quot;New descriptor-table size is #{new_size}&quot;

  EM.run {
    ...
  }
</pre>
<p>
If successful, this example will increase the maximum number of descriptors
that epoll can use to 60,000. Call <a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html#M000269">EventMachine#set_descriptor_table_size</a>
without an argument at any time to find out the current size of the
descriptor table.
</p>
<p>
Using <a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html#M000269">EventMachine#set_descriptor_table_size</a>
ONLY affects the number of descriptors that can be used by epoll. It has no
useful effect on platforms that don&#8216;t support epoll, and it does NOT
increase the number of descriptors that Ruby&#8216;s own I/O functions can
use.
</p>
<p>
set_descriptor_table_size can fail if your process is not running as
superuser, or if you try to set a table size that exceeds the hard limits
imposed by your system. In the latter case, try a smaller number.
</p>
<h3>Using <a href="../classes/EventMachine.html#M000268">EventMachine#set_effective_user</a></h3>
<p>
In general, you must run your program with elevated or superuser privileges
if you want to increase your descriptor-table size beyond 1024 descriptors.
This is easy enough to verify. Try running the sample program given above,
that increases the descriptor limit to 60,000. You will probably find that
the table size will not be increased if you don&#8216;t run your program as
root or with elevated privileges.
</p>
<p>
But of course network servers, especially long-running ones, should not run
with elevated privileges. You will want to drop superuser privileges as
soon as possible after initialization. To do this, use <a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html#M000268">EventMachine#set_effective_user</a>:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'eventmachine'

  # (Here, program is running as superuser)

  EM.set_descriptor_table_size( 60000 )
  EM.set_effective_user( &quot;nobody&quot; )
  # (Here, program is running as nobody)

  EM.run {
    ...
  }
</pre>
<p>
Of course, you will need to replace &quot;nobody&quot; in the example with
the name of an unprivileged user that is valid on your system. What if you
want to drop privileges after opening a server socket on a privileged
(low-numbered) port? Easy, just call set_effective_user after opening your
sockets:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'eventmachine'

  # (Here, program is running as superuser)

  EM.set_descriptor_table_size( 60000 )

  EM.run {
    EM.start_server( &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, 80, MyHttpServer )
    EM.start_server( &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, 443, MyEncryptedHttpServer )

    EM.set_effective_user( &quot;nobody&quot; )
    # (Here, program is running as nobody)

    ...
  }
</pre>
<p>
Because <a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html#M000268">EventMachine#set_effective_user</a>
is used to enforce security requirements, it has no nonfatal errors. If you
try to set a nonexistent or invalid effective user, set_effective_user will
abort your program, rather than continue to run with elevated privileges.
</p>
<p>
<a
href="../classes/EventMachine.html#M000268">EventMachine#set_effective_user</a>
is a silent no-op on platforms that don&#8216;t support it, such as
Windows.
